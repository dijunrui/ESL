## 1. Introduction

Core concept: To augment and replace the vector of inputs $X$ with additional variables which are transformations of $X$ and then use the linear models in this new space of derived input features. 

$$f(X) = \sum_{m=1}^M \beta_m h_m(X)$$

where $h_m(X): \mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a transformation of $X$. This is called a linear basis expansion in $X$.
